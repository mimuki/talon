# Gaming With Talon

This page is eventually designed to help you play your favorite games hands free, using [Talon Voice, a powerful (if complicated) tool](https://talonvoice.com).

## Games With Tutorials

- [Caves of Qud](/talon/CavesOfQud/) (WIP)

## Games Without Tutorials
These are games that others in the community have played, but setup guides haven't been written for them yet. Feel free to contribute your own guides, or just mention games that you've had success playing.

### No Extra Hardware Required
100% voice only! Hooray!
- Sudden Strike 4 See video https://youtu.be/5DBnzvKbQi4 [Talon commands:](https://github.com/Mark-Phillipson/talon_my_stuff/blob/main/sudden_strike_4.talon) 
- (probably a lot of retro console games in an emulator)

### Eye Tracking Only
These games are only going to be fun if you have an eye tracker- they are extremely mouse dependent, and might be too fast paced for other mouse alternatives. Otherwise, try them at your own peril.

- Diablo 3/4
- Magic the Gathering Arena
- Heros of Might and Magic 3
- Crumbled World
- The Longest Journey
- Slay the Spire
- Chants of Sennaar
